  You will be provided with multiple question questions and an multiple answers. 

  These questions are asked to the candidate over a telephinic conversation.
  You need to review how well the candidate has answered the questions technically.
  Check candidates answers again, expected_answer mentioned and rate how technically correct the answer is.

  Your goal is to carefully review this information and provide ratings for each answer.

  </answers_given>
  
Your task is to rate the candidate's answers on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is completely incorrect or irrelevant, and 10 is a perfect match to the best expected answer. 

For each question, follow these steps:
1. Consider the relevance, accuracy, and completeness of the candidate's response.
2. Evaluate how well the answer aligns technically with the question.
4. If its not a technical question evaluate the answer based on correctness and communication skills.
5. Provide a detailed reasoning for your rating in the <scratchpad> section for every query.
6. Assign a final rating from 0 to 10.

After completing your evaluation, provide your response in the following XML format:

<RESPONSE>
  <SCRATCHPAD>
    [Provide your step-by-step reasoning for each question here]
  </SCRATCHPAD>
  ${questions.map((question, idx) => {
    return `<QUESTION_RATING_${idx}>final rating</QUESTION_RATING_${idx}>;`;

Remember to provide thorough reasoning in the <SCRATCHPAD> section before giving your final ratings. Your evaluation should be fair, objective, and based solely on the information provided.
Make sure provide output strictly in xml format.`;

You will be provided with the job details, interview questions, best expected answers, and the candidate's actual responses. Your goal is to carefully review this information and provide ratings for each answer, as well as an assessment of the candidate's communication skills.

First, review the job details:

  <JOB_TITLE>
  ${classified_job_profile}
  </JOB_TITLE>

  <JOB_CRITERIA>
  ${job_criteria}
  </JOB_CRITERIA>

  Now, here are the interview questions and their best expected answers:

  Technical Question1: ${interviewObj.interview?.tech_questions?.question1}
  Best Expected Answer1: ${interviewObj.interview?.tech_questions?.answer1}

  Technical Question2: ${interviewObj.interview?.tech_questions?.question2}
  Best Expected Answer2: ${interviewObj.interview?.tech_questions?.answer2}

  Technical Question3: ${interviewObj.interview?.tech_questions?.question3}
  Best Expected Answer3: ${interviewObj.interview?.tech_questions?.answer3}

  Here are the answers given by the candidate:
  ${interviewObj.interview?.transcribe?.map((el, idx) => {
    return `<candidate_answer${idx}>${el.text}</candidate_answer${idx}>\n`;

Your task is to rate each of the candidate's answers on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is completely incorrect or irrelevant, and 10 is a perfect match to the best expected answer. Additionally, you should rate the candidate's overall communication skills based on their responses.
For each question, follow these steps:
1. Carefully compare the candidate's answer to the best expected answer.
2. Consider the relevance, accuracy, and completeness of the candidate's response.
3. Evaluate how well the answer aligns with the job criteria and requirements.
4. Provide a detailed reasoning for your rating in the <scratchpad> section.
5. Assign a final rating from 0 to 10.

After completing your evaluation, provide your response in the following XML format:

<RESPONSE>
