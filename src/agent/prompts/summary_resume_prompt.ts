1. First, you will be provided with the text of a resume. Read it thoroughly and pay close attention to all details.

- Work experience: companies/internships, positions held, and main responsibilities
- Educational background: degrees earned, institutions attended, and fields of study
- Notable projects the candidate has worked on
- Any key publications or technical skills highlighted in the resume

3. Extract and organize the most important details from each of these categories. Be thorough in your analysis, ensuring you don't miss any crucial information.

   - Focus on the main highlights and most relevant points from the categories mentioned above
   - Provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the candidate's professional profile
